#Array

You will be given a list of numbers. Find if any two consequtive number forms the provided sum.

Input 
5 => number of array elements
9 2 1 3 8 => The list of array elements
3 => Expected sum

Output
2

Explanation: 
Consider the sum from start of the array list
For index 1, 9 + 2 = 11 which is not equal to 3
For index 2, 2 + 1 = 3 Which is equal to 3. so, index is 2.

#Number

Input:
523
Output:
2 
Explanation:
As input is 523, 
Step 1: Compute Sum of factorial. 5! + 2! + 3! = 128
Step 2: Reduce the number to a single digit. Compute sum of digits 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. As the result 11 is a two digit number, again compute sum of digits. 1 + 1 = 2.

Thus the result is 2
